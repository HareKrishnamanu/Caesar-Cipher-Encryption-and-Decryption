# Caesar-Cipher-Encryption-and-Decryption

## Description

This project implements a Caesar Cipher for encrypting and decrypting text using Python. The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypts a given text by shifting the characters by a specified number of positions.
- **Decryption**: Decrypts an encrypted text by shifting the characters back by the same number of positions.
- **Customizable Shift**: Allows the user to specify the number of positions to shift (1-25).
- **Handles Uppercase and Lowercase Letters**: Maintains the case of the original text.
- **Ignores Non-Alphabetical Characters**: Numbers, spaces, and symbols are not altered by the cipher.

## How It Works

The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each letter in the input text by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:

- `A` becomes `D`
- `B` becomes `E`
- `C` becomes `F`

To decrypt, the process is reversed by shifting the characters back by the same number of positions.

## Running the Project

You can run this project in any Python environment or online compiler. Simply copy the code from the `caesar_cipher.py` file and execute it. 

## How to Use

1. **Encrypt a Message**: Enter the text you want to encrypt and specify the shift value.
2. **Decrypt a Message**: Enter the encrypted text and use the same shift value to retrieve the original message.
